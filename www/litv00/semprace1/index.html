    <p>
      New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar's year count increments by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner and the 1st day of January is often marked as a national
      holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Gregorian calendar, the most widely used calendar system today, New Year occurs on January 1 (New Year's
      Day). This was also the case both in the Roman calendar (at least after about 713 BC) and in the Julian calendar
      that succeeded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other calendars have been used historically in different parts of the world; some calendars count years
      numerically, while others do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Middle Ages in western Europe, while the Julian calendar was still in use, authorities moved New
      Year's Day, depending upon locale, to one of several other days, including March 1, March 25, Easter, September
      1, and December 25. Beginning in 1582, the adoptions of the Gregorian calendar and changes to the Old Style and
      New Style dates meant the various local dates for New Year's Day changed to using one fixed date, January 1.

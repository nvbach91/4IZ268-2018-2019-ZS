        <h1>Castles in Bohemia</h1>
        <p>A castle (from Latin: castellum) is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by
            predominantly the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars debate the scope of the word castle,
            but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a
            palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility;
            and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence â€“ though there are many similarities among
            these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as
            diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they
            took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and
            arrowslits, were commonplace.</p>

        <h1>Castles in Czechia</h1>

        <p>A castle (from Latin: castellum) is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by
            predominantly the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Over the approximately 900 years that castles
            were built, they
            took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and
            arrowslits, were commonplace.<br>

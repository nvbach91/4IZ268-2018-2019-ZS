                <p>Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā) is a former member of the Survey Corps and the main protagonist of
                    Attack on Titan. He lived in the Shiganshina District with his parents and adopted sister Mikasa
                    Ackerman until the fall of Wall Maria. During the incident, Eren impotently witnessed his mother
                    being eaten by a Titan.This event aroused in Eren an intense hatred towards the Titans, and he
                    swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.</p>
                <p>Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement,
                    instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with Titan
                    serum.</p>
                <p>In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa, and his best friend, Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps.
                    The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best,and they joined the Survey Corps following the
                    battle of Trost District.</p>
                <p>After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what
                    the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren vowed to free his home from their
                    true enemy: the world across the ocean.</p>
                <p>Eren currently possesses the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and
                    Founding Titans.After eating Willy's sister during the Battle of Liberio, he gained the War
                    Hammer Titan as well.</p>

                <p>Hajime Isayama is a Japanese manga artist. His first and currently ongoing series, Attack on
                    Titan, has become one of the best selling manga series of all time with 86 million copies in
                    circulation in October 2018.</p>
                <p>Isayama was born in Ōyama, Ōita Prefecture, Japan, which is now part of Hita. It was in high
                    school, Hita Rinko Senior High School, that he began submitting manga works to contests.After
                    graduating, he matriculated in the manga design program of the arts department at Kyushu
                    Designer Gakuen. In 2006, he applied for the Magazine Grand Prix known as MGP promoted by
                    Kodansha Ltd. and a short version of Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) was given the "Fine
                    Work" award. At age twenty, he moved to Tokyo and worked at an Internet café in order to pursue
                    a career in manga.This one-shot would later be included in the series' guidebook and included
                    with the first Blu-ray of the anime adaptation.</p>
                <p>Originally, he also offered his work to the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where he
                    was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Weekly Shōnen Jump. He
                    declined and decided instead to take it to the Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha
                    Ltd.</p>
                <p>In 2008, he applied for the 80th Weekly Shōnen Magazine Freshman Manga Award, where his work
                    Heart Break One was given the Special Encouragement Award. His other work, Orz, was chosen as a
                    selected work in the same contest the following year.</p>
                <p>In 2009, his first serial work, Attack on Titan, started in the monthly Bessatsu Shōnen
                    Magazine. It won the Shōnen category of the 35th Kodansha Manga Award in 2011,and was nominated
                    for both the 4th annual Manga Taishō award and the 16th annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural
                    Prize.Attack on Titan is released in English by Kodansha USA and has inspired five spin-off
                    manga series, three light novel series, a televised anime adaptation, several visual novels and
                    video games, and a two part live-action film. The resort Bungo Oyama Hibiki no Sato in his
                    hometown of Ōyama, ran a free exhibit displaying copies of Isayama's manuscripts for the manga
                    in 2013.A special Attack on Titan event was held in Hita on November 1, 2014, with Isayama and
                    approximately 2,500 spectators attending. The following day, Isayama gave a speech at the
                    Patria Hita cultural hall and was officially named the Tourism Ambassador of Hita by the city's
                    mayor Keisuke Harada.</p>

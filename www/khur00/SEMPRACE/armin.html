                <p>Armin Arlert (アルミン・アルレルト Arumin Arureruto) is an elite soldier in the Survey Corps. He is also a
                    childhood friend of Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman, and one of the two deuteragonists of the
                    series. Although he appears to be among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his
                    intelligence and strategic genius make him an invaluable asset, especially when paired with Hange
                    Zoë. After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertolt Hoover
                    and became the Colossus Titan.</p>
                <p>Armin has a boyish face, with large hazel eyes and a petite pointed nose which is always distinctly
                    a bit red. His blond hair is style in a long undercut with bangs over his entire forehead. Armin
                    has noticeably defined eyebrows and side burns, indicating of his age. His frame is, as it has
                    always been, relatively small and lacking in muscle but not definition. During the attack on
                    Liberio, Armin is seen wearing a standard cloak for hiding purposes before he transformed. He is
                    noticeably a bit taller and has his hair cut shorter.</p>
                <p>As a soldier in the Survey Corps, Armin is seen wearing their revamped black uniform for the night
                    raid on Marley.</p>
                <p>As a teen Armin was rather short for his age, though he had a somewhat defined build. He had a round
                    face with blond hair that is cut in the style of a bob and large expressive eyes with brown
                    eyebrows.</p>
                <p>Even when he was young, the naturally curious Armin had a deep fascination with the world beyond the
                    Walls.As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by
                    his grandfather. He told Eren Yeager, his best friend, about the book and the information that was
                    it contained. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside
                    world, and was thus frequently picked on.Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his
                    friends Eren and Mikasa Ackerman to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail
                    physique, was a source of much shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe
                    that he was a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his
                    worth. As a child, he hoped that one day he would be able to consider himself a true equal to his
                    friends.</p>

                <p>Levi Ackerman (リヴァイ・アッカーマン Rivai Akkāman), often formally referred to as Captain Levi (リヴァイ兵長 Rivai
                    Heichō), is the squad captain (兵士長 Heishichō, lit. "leader of the soldiers") of the Special
                    Operations Squad within the Survey Corps, and is widely known as humanity's strongest soldier.</p>
                <p>Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut, as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray
                    eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his
                    physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He
                    is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes
                    it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.</p>
                <p>He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray button up shirt underneath
                    along with his trademark white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also
                    wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to
                    injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.However, since the
                    beginning of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time during which the
                    Survey Corps were on the run from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical
                    maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.</p>
                <p>Levi is described as a "clean freak" by those who know him personally, as he prefers his environment
                    and himself to be spotlessly clean. He is averse to having either himself or his equipment soiled,
                    and has been known to wipe down his blood-smeared blades while still on the battlefield. However,
                    he will not hesitate to touch filth if he deems it necessary.</p>

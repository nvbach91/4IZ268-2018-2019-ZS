    - List of last posts on selected page

### Changed
- Instagram will not be implemented
- Changed not implemented feature into seperate page
- General logic methods have been moved into a separate js file
- Codebird library is now implemented using CDN
    - For some reason the only CDN version available has no method logout() that is part of the original library, but simply is not in the CDN version - user canâ€™t be logged out :/
- Minor code improvements and changes

### Notes
- Facebook doesn't support posting on user's timelines since october 2018, therefore the PUSH app posts on page
- There are many errors from facebook anytime API call is made - this is because the website has to be running on https, otherwise the call is deemed unsecure (but still works)
- There has to be a URL of the website the call is coming from entered as valid URL in the FB App Dashboard, otherewise and error will ocure
- Instagram will not be implemented, this is the version for approval

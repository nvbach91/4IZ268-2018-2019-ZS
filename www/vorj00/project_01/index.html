                <blockquote class="letter__part">
                    <p>On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter
                        to its
                        shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had
                        expected the letter; I was
                        surprised by the price.
                    </p>
                    <p> Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett
                        Partnership
                        Ltd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net
                        worth. Shortly before the
                        tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I
                        answered $11.50, and he
                        said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point
                        less. I bristled at Stanton’s
                        behavior and didn’t tender.</p>
                    <p>That was a monumentally stupid decision.</p>

                    <p>How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?</p>
                    <p>Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and
                        was completely trusted
                        by all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did
                        so, creating the Berkshire
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help
                        maximize Berkshire’s
                        achievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations.
                        Indeed, Berkshire’s
                        subsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And
                        some flourished while using
                        different systems.</p>

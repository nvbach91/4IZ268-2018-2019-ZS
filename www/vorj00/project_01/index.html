                <h2>Our humble story</h2>

                <p>Berkshire Hathaway, American holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska, that serves as an investment
                    vehicle for Warren Buffett. In the early 21st century, it was one of the largest corporations,
                    measured
                    by revenues, in the United States. The company was also notable for the high price of its stock
                    (more
                    than $250,000 for one Class A share in 2017) and the small size of its headquarters staff (about 25
                    people).</p>
                <p>
                    Berkshire Hathaway traces its history back to two Massachusetts textile firms: Hathaway
                    Manufacturing
                    Company (incorporated 1888) and Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company (incorporated 1889).
                    Berkshire
                    Cotton became Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates in 1929 and merged with Hathaway to form Berkshire
                    Hathaway, Inc., in 1955. An investment group led by Buffett took full control of the company in
                    1965.
                    Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile operations in 1985, by which time it was well-established
                    as
                    a holding company for Buffett’s other investments and corporate acquisitions.

                <h2>Warren Buffet</h2>
                <blockquote class="letter__part">
                    <p>On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter
                        to its
                        shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had
                        expected the letter; I was
                        surprised by the price.
                    </p>
                    <p> Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett
                        Partnership
                        Ltd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net
                        worth. Shortly before the
                        tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I
                        answered $11.50, and he
                        said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point
                        less. I bristled at Stanton’s
                        behavior and didn’t tender.</p>
                    <p>That was a monumentally stupid decision.</p>

                    <p>How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?</p>
                    <p>Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and
                        was completely trusted
                        by all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did
                        so, creating the Berkshire
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help
                        maximize Berkshire’s
                        achievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations.
                        Indeed, Berkshire’s
                        subsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And
                        some flourished while using
                        different systems.</p>

barcodes.js
	- main HTML initialization
	- MAIN input ids: 				cells-count, label-name, barcode-input
	- ADDITIONAL SETT input ids:	skip-cells, row-cells-count, cell-height

barcodes.css
	- #cell: responsible for cell size

IDEAS
	- 1) multiple cell ids based on alza layouts
		- instead of cell-height and row-cells-count, selection between the layout sizes
	- 2) edit #cell with jQuery 
		- partly integrated by having cell-height and row-cells-count inputs in the settings

barcodes.js
	- main HTML initialization
	- MAIN input ids: 				cells-count, label-name, barcode-input
	- ADDITIONAL SETT input ids:	skip-cells, row-cells-count, cell-height, set-settings
	- canvas

barcodes.css
	- #cell: responsible for cell size

jsbarcode.js (DO NOT EDIT)
	- draws canvas on the cell
		- barcode and text

IDEAS
	CELL SIZE
		- 1) multiple cell ids based on alza layouts (EASIER USER EXPERIENCE)
			- instead of cell-height and row-cells-count, selection between the layout sizes
		- 2) edit #cell with jQuery [WORKING]
			- partly integrated by having cell-height and row-cells-count inputs in the settings

	PAPER SIZE
		- A4 = 210x297 cm
		- program needs the ability to edit the size of the printing layout
		- 1) add on top either the ability to edit margins
		- 2) or the ability to edit gaps between cells
		

	BARCODE & TEXT size
		- 1) edit barcodes.js to work in percentage size of cell? 

	PADDING AS A TYPE OF CELL
		- only need a general ability to safeguard 260 cells

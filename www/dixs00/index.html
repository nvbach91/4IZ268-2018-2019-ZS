                  <h2>Why have lessons with Sebastian?</h2>
                  <p>Usually, people look for private teachers because they need to practice speaking in a
                        foreign
                        language.
                        They pay native speakers to sit in cafés and talk to them for an hour. But ... Is that
                        all?
                        Don't you
                        expect more for your money?
                  </p>
                  <h2>Yes, you can and should expect more!</h2>
                  <p>We both know you need more! You need to know what you should improve! You need a
                        step-by-step
                        strategy,
                        you need a method and you need guidance! You don't need a "guy you can pay to talk to
                        you", you
                        need
                        <strong>an actual teacher</strong> - a person who cares about your progress! That's me.</p>

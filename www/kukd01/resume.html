  <h1>DJ Snake</h1>

    DJ Snake is a Grammy-nominated producer and artist who debuted into the international scene with singles "Bird
    Machine" and "Turn Down for What" in 2013. "Bird Machine" is a collaboration with fellow French musician Alesia.
    The single was picked up by Mad Decent, a Los Angeles-based record label run by Diplo, and released in February
    2013. In June 2013, DJ Snake was invited by Diplo to do a live mix on his radio show, "Diplo & Friends", which airs
    on BBC Radio 1.

    DJ Snake was announced to be working on a collaboration with Diplo, originally slated to debut in 2014; it
    eventually released in 2015 as the single "Lean On" in collaboration with MØ and Diplo's Major Lazer. On 30 April

  <p>DJ Snake was born to Algerian parents in Paris and grew up in Ermont,
    a banlieue district outside Paris, which he describes as a ghetto.
    He cites a scene with Cut Killer in the French film La Haine as well as hip-hop artists
    KRS-One and Cypress Hill as early influences. In his youth, DJ Snake produced graffiti art,
    earning him the moniker "Snake" because he was able to consistently evade the police. Of his name,
    DJ Snake says "When I started DJing, everyone called me ‘Snake’ in my city first, I was like ‘DJ Snake,
    OK let’s go for it.’ The name sucks, but it’s too late now."
    He started DJ-ing at age 14, and later producing at 19 years old.
    In his early career, DJ Snake performed at clubs including Les Bains Douches in Paris.
    In 2005, he met his manager Steve Goncalves, who encouraged DJ Snake to begin creating his own music.

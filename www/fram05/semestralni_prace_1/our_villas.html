        <h1 class="regular_h1" style="border-top: none;">BEACH POOL VILLA</h1>
        <p class="regular_article">These detached one-bedroom beach front villas are sumptuously furnished. Mahogany
            louvered panels and
            intricate lofty ceilings impart a colonial feel, while teak furniture and suspended bamboo lights bring
            nature indoors. Wall to wall glass doors frame the terrace and private pool. By day the villas are
            filled with light, yet remain secluded by clusters of palms.</p>
        <p class="regular_article">An indoor bathroom with Romeo and Juliet basins opens onto a large outdoor bathroom
            connected by a
            garden atrium where a gazebo covered daybed overlooks the oversized tub. Day beds, swinging chairs and
            an alfresco dining area face the Indian Ocean.</p>

        <p class="regular_article">Accessible only by boat, this ultra-private one-bedroom villa suspended above the
            lagoon with

            honeymooners or those who are looking for ultra-luxury, including a private chef and butler.</p>
        <p class="regular_article">All rooms open onto the terraces, where the Jacuzzi, pool, sundeck and sunken bath
            offer varying aspects
            towards the horizon. Dine inside or over the water in a dining gazebo on its own jetty at sunset, or
            enjoy sundowners on the sumptuous daybeds. The interiors are designed with natural materials and
            neutral colours with occasional ikat accents or animal prints. With a personal gym and spa treatment

        <p class="regular_article">With uninterrupted ocean views and private pools facing the sunset, these villas are
            dreamlike in
            design. Separated by canvas sails, they ensure the utmost privacy. Thatched roofing shades the outdoor
            dining area, while the bedroom and bathroom open onto the terrace.</p>

        <p class="regular_article">The pool and sun deck have steps leading into the ocean, while under the gazebo a
            vast daybed scattered
            with cushions catches the final moments of the sunset. Inside, the large comfortable living room has
            its own bar area complete with a private wine fridge and is designed around a viewing window set into
            the floor. Huge bathrooms with circular baths and a swinging chair reflect the water surrounding the
            villa.</p>

            two-bedroom
            overwater residence fringed with traditional thatch offers an elegant living space with carefully
            curated elements. Louvered shutters let the breeze flow through, while a deep sofa is covered in
            scatter cushions, ideal for settling down with a good book.</p>


        <p class="regular_article">The dining area provides a central space while the ocean is the backdrop from every
            aspect – from the
            two spacious bathrooms featuring circular baths, to the elegant bedrooms. Swim in your own pool and
            relax on the sun deck, or step directly into the lagoon. Kick back under one of two gazebos – one with
            a sunken hot tub and the other with daybeds.</p>

        <p class="regular_article">Imagine the definitive ultimate beach residence. With four bedrooms accommodating up

            metres of private interior and exterior space, inclusive of two terraces, a pool and a courtyard.</p>

            elegance in equal measures. These two-storey detached residences are laid out with privacy in mind.
            Each of the four bedrooms face the ocean across a stretch of icing sugar sand; the first floor bedrooms
            have generous balconies, while the ground floor rooms open onto the pool. Indoor and outdoor bathrooms
            are connected by a garden atrium.</p>

        <p class="regular_article">Flanked by two gazebos for dining, relaxation or playing, the pool reflects the
            ocean and is the central
            focus. Behind the living space a gym, spa room and outdoor living area offer plenty of quiet spaces to
            retire to. These residences set a new level of ultimate luxury in the Maldives for friends and families
            alike.</p>
